About
- This project, along with other cloud apps is done as a proof of concept and as a tool to fill a personal need. Pull requests will not be accepted as i need to keep this all my own work, feature requests are accepted. Full cross browser testing has not been done, these apps will work on latest webkit browsers (chrome/safari), but not in IE6.
- Why all Public methods/properties? Simple answer, why not? This code is not intended for multi user use with class extensions and modules hanging of it. Although open source, the integration of the code is very much closed and secure, declaring a method as private/protected isn't going to change anything. Leaving everything public makes it easier for any future developments as classes are not restricted.
